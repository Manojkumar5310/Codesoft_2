üé¨ Movie Rating Prediction with Python üçø

This repository contains the code for a movie rating prediction project developed during my internship at Codsoft Company. Using Python and machine learning techniques, I built a robust predictive model to estimate movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and actors.

Key Features:
- Implemented regression algorithms using scikit-learn to predict movie ratings.
- Engineered features and applied frequency encoding for enhanced model performance.
- Utilized parallel processing and hyperparameter tuning for efficient model training and evaluation.
- Achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.74, demonstrating the accuracy of the predictive model.

This project showcases my skills in data science, machine learning, and Python programming. It's been an invaluable learning experience, and I'm excited to share it with the community.

Stay tuned for updates and improvements to the projectüöÄ
